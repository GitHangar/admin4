<h3>Server is not instrumented</h3>
<p>
$APPNAME implements some advanced features, which require additional procedures and tables in the 
maintenance database to work. These advanced features are:
<ul>
<li>aborting connections on the connection status page
<li>Favorite objects in the browser tree
<li>SQL code Snippets in the SQL query tool
<li>Filter Presets in the data tool
</ul>
Favorites, Snippets and Presets are stored in database tables personal to the user you're using to connect, and are 
instantly available on every computer you're connecting from using $APPNAME. 
</p><p>
To prepare the server for improved handling through $APPNAME, execute the <code><b>instrument</b></code>
context menu on the server object and close the connection. After re-opening the connection, the instrumentation
state will be detected and the advanced features are available. 
</p><p>
Note: The namespace used for configuration storage is configured in Preferences/PostgreSQL.
