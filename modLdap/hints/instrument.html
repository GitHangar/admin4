<h3>Server is not instrumented</h3>
<p>
$APPNAME implements some advanced features, which requires an additional entry in the 
LDAP database to work. These advanced features are:
<ul>
<li>configuration of automatic POSIX uid/gid and SAMBA rid generation for new users/groups
<li>configuration of editing panels when editing specific LDAP entries (see documentation for details)
</ul>
This configuration is available on every computer you're connecting from via $APPNAME. 
</p><p>
To prepare the server for improved handling through $APPNAME, execute the <code><b>instrument</b></code>
context menu on the server object and close the connection. After re-opening the connection, the instrumentation
state will be detected and the advanced features are available. 
</p><p>
Note: The RDN used for configuration storage is configured in Preferences/LDAP.
